'''
Through command line arguments three strings separated by space are given
to you. Each string is a series of numbers separated by hyphen(-). You like all
the numbers in string 1 and dislike all the numbers in string 2.

Third string contains the numbers given to you. Your initial happiness is 0.
When you encounter a number which is present in string 1, add 1 to your

happiness, if it is present in string 2, add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your
happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

Sample input 1: 3-1 5-7 1-5-3-8
Sample output 1: 1
Explanation:
Numbers in string 1: 3, 1
Numbers in string 2: 5, 7
Numbers given to you: 1, 5, 3, 8

You gain 1 unit of happiness for numbers 1 and 3 which are in string 1. Your
total happiness is 2 now.
You lose 1 unit of happiness for number 5 which is in string 2. Your total
happiness in 1 now.
